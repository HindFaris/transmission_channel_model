# Transmission Channel Simulator
This project allows the simulation of a transmission channel. The transmitter sends an analog message that can be encoded in RZ, NRZ, or NRZT formats. The number of samples and amplitude can also be simulated.
We can simulate a perfect transmission or a multi-path transmission with noise. The receiver attempts to decode the message sent by the transmitter and calculates the bit error rate.
